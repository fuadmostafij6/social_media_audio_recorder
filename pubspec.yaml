  # To add assets to your package, add an assets section, like this:
  # assets:

  #
  # For details regarding assets in packages, see

  # To add custom fonts to your package, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
